      <p>
        7500 BCE is the earliest known evidence of cat domestication. Archaeologists discovered a burial with a cat's skeleton alongside a human in Shillourokambos, Cyprus. During this time, cats were not native to the island, suggesting that humans intentionally brought them and valued them as companions.

     In ancient Egyptian societies, cats became important companions for protecting crops from rats and other pests, and were also associated with religous figures such as Bastet, the protector goddess. As a common practice at the time, Cats were mummified in as a religious offering to honor and worship the gods.

      By 1500 BCE, the domestication of cats began spreading from Egypt into other parts of the Mediterranean and Asia through trade routes. Cats were predominantly recognized as companions and protectors by sailors and merchants, and they have become established in various regions.

       The world's very first cat show was held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871. The event marked the rise of selective breeding and its growing international attention. The view of cats has shifted from being originally seen as working animals to having standards for various breeds as pets.

I used a previous student's work as visual and functional inspiration to get an idea for a simplified version of the timeline and making the buttons change the info and images on the page like they have in their work.
